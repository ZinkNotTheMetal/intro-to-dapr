## DAST

- Dynamic Application Security Testing is useful for detecting misconfiguration for servers or databases that affect web application security during runtime. It can also catch authentication and encryption issues allowing unauthorized access.
  - DAST can test other API or web services your web application connects to. In addition to IT infrastructure resources like networking and data storage. So DAST is valuable for testing the entire IT environment where your application or web services operate
  - A common tool for DAST testing is AppScan

## SAST

- Static application security testing - analyzes program source code to identify security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities include SQL injections, buffer overflows, XML external unity (XXE) attacks and other OWASP top 10 security risks.
  - The SAST methodology guides developers to begin testing their application at early development stages without executing a functional component.
  - A common tool for SAST testing is Checkmarx
